2. What is columnar data format? what are the advantages?

    columnar data format is when data is stored in columns blocks instead of rows. this makes encoding easier since all of the
    data is of the same type.

3. What is encoding? Different type of encoding? A sample create table statement with encoding.

    encoding is when you specify a type of compression to use on your table in order to save space on the disk. redshift will
    choose a compression encoding for you if you do not specify one on table creation. two different compression encodings are
    AZ64 which is great for numbers and Zstandard which is good for data that has a lot of different values such as varchars

    create table encode_test(
        id int encode AZ64,
        description varchar(80) encode Zstd
    )


4. What is distribution key? How it is helpful in query performance.

    a distribution key is used to specify where in the nodes the data that you would like is stored so that it optimized
    in a way that data that is most likely to be queried at the same time is stored together in memory. This helps query
    performance by having the disk read from fewer places before getting the output.
