1. Create  a file:
col:
product_name varchar(20),
manufacturingcost decimal(5,2)

For each product build record using python script.
'iphon11','iphone12','iphone13','iphoneSE','IpadMax','IpadMini','laptop256','Macbook512',
'galaxy10','galaxy11','galaxy12','galaxy13','watch320','watch340'
'Nk320',''Nk400',''Nk500'

File example:
iphon11,220
iphone12,250
iphone13,290


create a table in redshift also.-- table name product_cost

2. Load data into s3 in separate folder (order data must be created earlier in class project 3).
3. Use copy command  to load data into redshift by.
4  create a view by joining order and product_cost.


5. Create a bucket using boto3 and then list the buckets (from the metadata). make sure the bucket exists else fail.
6. Unload data from view into s3 bucket (this has to be separate bucket then created earlier) buckets/transformation/vw_name/    (this has ot be a csv file with header)


7. Create a new view by taking all the records where you have profit. Profit is sales amount -manufacturingcost. So add all the fields from order table
and cost from product_cost.
8. Create col as profit_group the values are [ if profit percenatge is more 10% the "Bumper profit", it is 0 to 10% then "Marginal profit"
if it is -5% to 0% then "Loss making" else "Bumper Loss"
9. Unload the view into a s3 file.
10. Create another view to show total profit by each brand_name,year-mth cd (ex:202201,202203). Do a rank by the total profit (desc) and
amount of product sold (Asc)
11. unload data to a CSV file wtih header and pipe delimited


## Hints
sql questin

import boto3

client = boto3.client('s3')
response = client.list_buckets()
print(response)
response = client.create_bucket(
Bucket='chris123')

session = boto3.Session(profile_name='dev_acct')
